# How a single developer managed the workload

- Working a FT job, so finding time to do this isn't easy.
- Need to set a work/life/side-project life balance.
	- Early on I did not do this.
	- Set up 2 week periods which I called suicide windows. Personal life was sacrificed for side-project productivity.
	- Then took a week off to mentally recharge and do fun me things.

## Tech Debt

- Impossible to avoid, but
  - One day every week was setup for code quality improvements, ie no feature work.
  - One day every other week was setup for design related improvements (non-functional).
  - Other days were spent productivily building features while attempting to follow good practices, but not letting them become a mental block; they can get resolved on a day who's focus is tech debt relief.

## Code Generation

- See Article about this.
- Negatives here: you have to limit generated code only what you actually need universally (skeleton bare minimum).

## Life-long understanding of the industry

- This helped a lot, as some decisions had already been made 6 years ago.
