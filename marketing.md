## What is Zenbership?

Zenbership is an open source suite of tools designed to make membership management, digital file delivery, digital grants, and subscription management easy. With a flexible database structure designed to fit the needs of any industry, Zenbership can be dropped into almost any platform and act as the backbone for all your data management needs. And with a built-in programmatic hook and plugin system, Zenbership can easily be expanded to fit varioususe cases.

This will save your company countless man hours designing and developing boilerplate data injestion tool, allowing you to focus on feature work.

## Why PHP?

Zenbership's primary goal is to be accessible to companies of all sizes. PHP's ubiquity and ease of deployment make it an ideal candidate. The tool can be deployed easily to hosting environments of all kinds, from basic shared hosting plans to cloud-based providers. While strong considerations were made towards Typescript, in the end modern PHP was chosen.

## Components

### The API

This is the primary point of contact for all business logic required to run Zenbership.

### The Frontend Client

The frontend client is what members of your organization will see and acts as the UX for the application.

### The Administrative Client

## Long-Term Support

Offered on various version of the application.

# Concepts

## Guest Sessions

"Offer one time sessions to potential members, allowing for limited time access to the site all while grabbing valuable contact information in the process, making the transition to paid member that much easier."

# Flexibility of Usage (Clients?)

"Flexibility around the API allows for all types of orgazations to benefits: online memberships with online portals, in person clubs and events (yoga studios, health clubs and gyms, event halls). Since frontend clients (phone apps, websites, etc.) can be designed to employ the fleixibility of the API freely, the API offers freedome to businesses of all kinds to who want to design custom platforms that offer this functionality."
